# Vue3 Truffle Box

This box comes with everything you need to start using Truffle to write, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts, and interact with them from a Vue3 app.

## Installation

First ensure you are in an empty directory.

Run the `unbox` command using 1 of 2 ways.

```sh
# Install Truffle globally and run `truffle unbox`
$ npm i -g truffle
$ truffle unbox vue3
```

```sh
# Alternatively, run `truffle unbox` via npx
$ npx truffle unbox vue3
```

Start the react dev server.

```sh
$ cd app
$ pnpm dev
  Starting the development server...
```
