# Vue3 Truffle Box

This box comes with everything you need to start using Truffle to write, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts, and interact with them from a Vue3 app.

## Installation

First ensure you are in an empty directory.

Run the `unbox` command using 1 of 2 ways.

```sh
# Install Truffle globally and run `truffle unbox`
npm i -g truffle
truffle unbox vue3
```

```sh
# Alternatively, run `truffle unbox` via npx
npx truffle unbox vue3
```

Start the vue dev server.

```sh
cd app
pnpm dev
  Starting the development server...
```

## Thanks

I also write this box out of the mentality of learning. So thanks to the author of Pet-box, Cds-amal, because the material and contracts of Vue3-box come from pet-box. It is very hard for me to find the mererial. Thanks again. If you do not want to, please contact me and I will replace in time.
